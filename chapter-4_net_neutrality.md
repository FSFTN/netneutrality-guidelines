## CHAPTER 4
# NET NEUTRALITY

1. Net Neutrality is a concept fundamental to the Internet. It provides the space in which a free-market economy, innovation and fundamental liberties of persons can realise itself. 
2. Network neutrality is the principle that all Internet traffic should be treated equally.
3. Government of India will advocate for an Open Internet - The idea of an open Internet is the idea that the full resources of the Internet and means to operate on it are easily accessible to all individuals and companies. 
4. The GoI will act to ensure that TSP’s and ISP’s treat internet connectivity as a dumb pipe service.
- The idea of a dumb network is that the endpoints of a network are generally where the intelligence lies, and that the network itself generally leaves the management and operation of communication to the end user
- All TSP networks will be ‘dumb networks’ - A dumb network is marked by using intelligent devices (i.e. PCs) at the periphery that make use of a network that does not interfere or manage with an application’s operation / communication.
5. GoI will ensure that end to end principle is followed.
- The end-to-end principle states that in a general-purpose network, application-specific functions ought to reside in the end hosts of a network rather than in intermediary nodes, provided that they can be implemented "completely and correctly" in the end hosts. 
6. The protection of privacy is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In a democratic society, privacy is an enabler for other fundamental rights, such as the freedom of expression and to form and join associations
