#CHAPTER 2
##USER RIGHTS

1. Internet users have the right to use lawful content, application, service, and not harmful devices or equipment freely, and to be provided with information regarding Internet traffic management by related carriers.
2. Internet users mean end users.
3. Subscribers of Internet access service have the right to receive and use a public and globally unique Internet address.
4.  Any techniques to inspect or analyse Internet traffic shall be in accordance with privacy and data protection legislation. By default, such techniques should only examine header information. The use of any technique which inspects or analyses the content of communications should be reviewed by the relevant national data protection authority to assess compliance with the applicable privacy and data protection obligations.
5. Internet service providers shall provide intelligible and transparent information with regard to their traffic management practices and usage polices, notably with regard to the coexistence of Internet access service and specialised services. When network capacity is shared between Internet access services and specialised services, the criteria whereby network capacity is shared, shall be clearly stated.
6. The principle of neutrality shall be respected by any action or decision affecting the organization, provision, or use of a network accessible to the public. This principle means the prohibition of discrimination related to content, senders or recipients of digital data communications.


## PRINCIPALS TO BE ADHERED TO BY SERVICE PROVIDERS

*Principle 1*: Internet users are entitled to an Internet connection with a predefined capacity and quality. This means that:

1. The capacity and quality of the Internet connection is to be clearly specified.
2. If the physical connection is shared with other services, it must be stated clearly how the capacity is shared between Internet traffic and the other services.
3. The capacity and quality of the Internet connection is to be clearly specified. This principle states that Internet users are to be given sufficient information about the characteristics of the Internet connection, so that they know what resource is being provided for communication with the Internet in the form this has traditionally had. This is normally referred to as “best effort” Internet.
4. If the connection is shared with other services, it must be stated clearly how the capacity is shared between Internet traffic and the other services. The connection service that a customer subscribes to from a provider shall have as its primary function – or one of its primary functions – to provide the end user with access to the Internet. If other services are provided to the user in addition to the Internet connection, the subscription terms must state how the use of the other services will affect the Internet access capacity.

*Principle 2:*  Internet users are entitled to an Internet connection that enables them to - send and receive content of their choice (i) use services and run applications of their choice, (ii) connect hardware and use software of their choice that do not harm the network. This principle states that the user shall have free use of the basic Internet connection. An important characteristic of Internet technology is that it can be used for all forms of communication, which is why it is important that this characteristic is not degraded by the provider.

*Principle 3:* Internet users are entitled to an Internet connection that is free of discrimination with regard to type of application, service or content or based on sender or receiver address. This means that there shall be no discrimination among individual data streams that use the basic Internet service. But it does not mean that the principle precludes traffic management efforts on an operator’s own network to block activities that harm the network, comply with orders from the authorities, ensure the quality of service for specific applications that require this, deal with special situations of temporary network overload or prioritise traffic on an individual user’s connection according to the user’s wishes.

1. There shall be no discrimination among individual data streams that use the basic Internet service. This principle states that the sharing of capacity among users shall be done in the fairest and most efficient manner that ensures a functional Internet. This is a matter that is difficult to define precisely. Since different users (on both ends of the various communication sessions) can be connected to the network at different bandwidths, it is reasonable that they will experience different capacity for end-to-end communication. As the competition for bandwidth will typically occur on particular places on the network, either network internal connections, external peering/transit connections and the actual access connection, the principle should apply to all types of communication lines within the framework that the connection contracts (subscription contracts, peering/transit contracts, SLAs, etc.) set. An absolutely fair sharing of bandwidth for all Internet users applied to all communication lines would be difficult to achieve in practice. Inherent in the principle, however, is that there must be no unreasonable manipulation or degradation of traffic for individual data streams.
2. However, this principle does not preclude traffic management efforts on an operator’s own network to block activities that harm the network, comply with orders from the authorities, ensure the quality of service for specific applications that require this, deal with special situations of temporary network overload or prioritise traffic on an individual user’s connection according to the user’s wishes. If it becomes necessary to manage traffic streams on the network for these reasons, the operator must be able to account for how this management complies with the principle. There must be a distinction between giving priority to traffic without the user’s consent and prioritising that is done on the user’s own Internet connection according to the user’s wishes. Some users may need help from the provider to prioritise the traffic on their own connection when the amount of traffic exceeds total capacity. In principle it is not at variance with network neutrality when this is done for an individual user in isolation. This requires, however, that the users have a real opportunity to choose an Internet connection without prioritising. The methods for measures of this type shall be published and disclosed to users.
